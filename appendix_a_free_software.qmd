## QGIS {#sec-open-resouces-software-QGIS}
QGIS is a free and open source Geographical Information System that offers very similar tools as their commercial counterparts. The latest version of QGIS can be downloaded from the [QGIS website](https://qgis.org/en/site/). We recommend to install the stable long-term support version ([installation guide](#appendix-sofware-qgis-installation-guide)).  

### Resources for learning QGIS {#sec-open-resouces-learning-QGIS}
A general tutorial for beginners is the  [QGIS training manual](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/training_manual/index.html). It includes a short chapter on the use of QGIS for hydrological analysis (Chapter 17.16).
