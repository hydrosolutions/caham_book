# Part II: Data Sources, Retrieval and Preparation {#sec-data}

In this Chapter, we will discuss how to retrieve, prepare and process the data that is required for hydrological modeling.

Data include
- in-situ station data,
- geospatial data,
- snow and glacier data, and
- climate reanalysis and projections data.

As will become clear, the preparation of these data requires a substantial amount of work, local storage space and, in some instances, computational power. The preparation of these data is described in this Part and the corresponding Chapters.

Data needs vary according to the modeling approach and the model chain. As an example, for river basin-level climate impact modeling, the flow diagram in @fig-climate-impact-model-chain shows the required steps for the preparation of the individual data types for modeling.
