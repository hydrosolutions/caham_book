This Chapter provides a broad overview of relevant available data sources. All these data can be accessed via download from the web free of charge except where otherwise mentioned.

The Chapters @sec-discharge-station-data, @sec-geospatial-data, @sec-snow-and-glacier-data, and @sec-climate-data describe in detail how these data can be prepared for hydrological modeling with RSMinerve. Before this, the following @sec-discharge-gauge-location provides an in-depth discussion of the derivation of a consistent set of gauge location data.

## Gauge Location & Norm Discharge Data {#sec-discharge-gauge-location}

The Central Asia Hydrometeorological Organizations are the organizations administering discharge data. Unfortunately, the organizations do not have a good understanding of most of the past and current locations where they monitor this discharge. This can be verified by checking the website [Hydrometeorological Services in Central Asia](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=ac03200e7b834193938d95c38b58a15b){target="_blank"} where many of the shown gauges are not correctly georeferenced.

This is problematic for many reasons, especially for GIS analysis and hydrological modeling. With a focus on the mountain rivers, we developed a workflow to verify gauge locations communicated by Hydrometeorological Organizations in a consistent and comprehensive manner. With the goal of establishing a comprehensive archive, this workflow was applied to map operational stations and past stations.

First, data from all existing gauges and locations were entered into a data frame with the following attributes:

-   **CODE**: Official gauge code in use
-   **EASTING** and **NORTHING**: Coordinates in UTM42N
-   **LON** and **LAT**: Longitude and latitude
-   **NAME_ENG**: Translated English station name
-   **NAME_RU**: Original station name
-   **RIVER**: Name of river
-   **BASIN**: Name of the larger basin
-   **COUNTRY**: The country the gauge is located in
-   **Q_NORM_M3S**: Long-term norm discharge
-   **OBS_PERIOD**: Observation period of long-term norm discharge
-   **SOURCE**: Source of information on norm discharge

Second, data on historic stations were obtained from the Soviet compendia Surface Water Resources, Vol 14 Issues 1 and 3. Third, data from northern Afghan rivers' stream flow characteristics and the location of gauging stations there were obtained from [@usgs_529_2010]. Norm discharge was calculated from the available data.

All stations were manually located in a Geographic Information System (GIS) using the relevant Soviet Military Topographic maps (1:200'000) from the corresponding region. The maps were downloaded from <https://maps.vlasenko.net> and subsequently georeferenced in QGIS with the `Raster/Georeferencr` tool there [@QGIS_software]. Where possible, high-resolution satellite imagery from Microsoft® Bing™ Maps was used to identify measurement bridges and for final validation of the identified locations.

The upstream catchments for each gauge were then mapped in R using the [WhiteboxTools v.2.0.0](https://cran.r-project.org/package=whitebox){target="_blank"}. Like this, we have compiled a list of 297 gauges with their contributing catchments. @fig-ca-gauges-basin shows the result. For more information, please see [@marti2023].

![Geographic overview over mapped basins. The pastel colors encode the mountainous catchments of the corresponding large basins. See @siegfried_unveiling_2023 for more information.](images/data/gauges_basin.jpg){#fig-ca-gauges-basin}

For all basins, mean statistics were computed from the digital elevation model, the land cover data, climatological and glacier data, as well as from 1979 through 2012 for mean average monthly temperature and precipitation, and finally, the monthly snow cover fraction derived from MODIS Terra and Aqua Snow Cover Data Product which is available from 2001 through the end of 2021.

The norm discharge data presented here are used for the long-term water balance modeling presented in @sec-budyko-modeling in Part III of the book. For selected stations and river basins, we have time series available that can be used to calibrate time-dependent models. Some of these data and their processing will be presented and discussed in @sec-discharge-station-data.

## Vector data {#sec-vector-data-sources}

For our purpose, we define the area of interest (AOI) as 55 deg. E - 85. deg. E and 30 deg. N - 50 deg. N..

Global political boundaries can be obtained from the Global Administrative Divisions database at [gadm.org](www.gadm.org){target="_blank"}. Except for Turkmenistan, data on first (Oblast) and second-level (Rayon) administrative divisions is available for all Central Asian states.

Shapefiles of large river basins can be retrieved from the [Global Runoff Data Center](https://www.bafg.de/GRDC/EN/01_GRDC/grdc_node.html){target="_blank"}. Note that for the Central Asian region, the flat downstream areas of these basins are delineating natural hydrological borders. They do not account for man-made inter-basin transfers and thus would need to be corrected where necessary.

The river network can be obtained from the Global Runoff Data Center WMOBB data that was released in 2021. It can be downloaded via this [link](https://www.bafg.de/SharedDocs/ExterneLinks/GRDC/wmobb_shp_zip.html?nn=201274){target="_blank"}. With 161 MB, approx., data covering the whole globe can be downloaded in a straightforward manner. The global data can be clipped easily with the bounding box defined above.

Data for the large rivers can be extracted from the layer wmobb_rivnets_Q09_10 (containing line sections representing an upland area above 4'504 km^2^). The layer called wmobb_rivnets_Q08_09 contains line sections representing an upland area between 1'150 km^2^ and 4'504 km^2^ and, finally, the wmobb_rivnets_Q07_08 (containing line sections representing an upland area above between 487 and 1'150 km^2^) [@grdc_2020]. Smaller rivers can be further added to a QGIS project on a case-per-case basis using the additional data sets in the files obtained from GRDC.

Permanent water bodies and courses can be obtained from the global HydroLakes Database [@hydrolakes_2016]. It can be downloaded via this [link](https://www.hydrosheds.org/pages/hydrolakes){target="_blank"}.

Glacier data can be taken from the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) 6.0. The inventory contains a global archive of glacier outlines and can be obtained via this [website](https://www.glims.org/RGI/){target="_blank"}. Information from 16'617 glaciers is available in the AOI. The corresponding data on glacier thickness and glacier thinning rates is available as complementary data [@farinotti_consensus_2019, @hugonnet_accelerated_2021]. More information on these data can be found in @sec-snow-and-glacier-data, whereas glacier models are discussed in a separate [Section](#sec-glacier-models) in the Chapter on [Hydrological Modeling](#sec-hydrological-modeling).

Data on dams is available from the GOODD data set. Information from 88 dams in the region of interest is mapped [@goodd_2020]. The data is available from [Global Dams Watch](http://globaldamwatch.org/goodd/){target="_blank"}.

## Raster Data {#sec-raster-data-sources}

The NASA SRTM digital elevation model 1 Arc-second (30 m) global product is used as a DEM [@srtm_2020]. There are many ways to access these data, some more, some less convenient. An easy way to access these data is in QGIS by using the [SRTM-Downloader Plugin](https://github.com/hdus/SRTM-Downloader){target="_blank"}. For web-based access, it is recommended to utilize the [NASA EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov){target="_blank"}. Sample instructions on how to download DEM data from the EarthExplorer can, for example, be found by watching the following YouTube tutorial.

```

Land cover information can be obtained from the Copernicus Global Land Service: Land Cover 100m: collection 3: epoch 2019: Globe data [@copernicus_landcover_2019]. The [Global Land Cover Viewer](https://lcviewer.vito.be/2015) allows to access, view and download annual land cover data from 2015 - 2019.

High-resolution climate data can be obtained from the Climatologies at High Resolution for the Earth’s Land Surface Areas (CHELSA) dataset via [www.chelsa-climate.org](https://chelsa-climate.org){target="_blank"}. For the Version 2.1 product, climatologies for the periods 1981 - 2010, 2011 - 2040, 2041 - 2070, and 2071 - 2100 for a large number of variables are available for [download as GeoTiff-files](https://envicloud.wsl.ch/#/?prefix=chelsa%2Fchelsa_V2%2FGLOBAL%2F){target="_blank"}. With regard to the daily data, it is recommended to use the [Global daily 1km land surface precipitation based on cloud cover-informed downscaling](https://chelsa-climate.org/daily-precipitation/){target="_blank"}. This precipitation product reflects actual conditions in High-Mountain Asia in a much better way than the precipitation from the CHELSA-W5E5 V1.1 product. For daily temperature, the data from the CHELSA-W5E5 V1.1 product can be downloaded for a given domain of interest via this [link](https://data.isimip.org/10.48364/ISIMIP.836809){target="_blank"}.

::: callout-warning
Note that the daily high-resolution climate fields for the entire Central Asia domain require a lot of storage space. Their processing for later analysis is computationally intensive.

The FLO1K, global maps of mean, maximum and minimum annual stream flow at 1 km resolution from 1960 through 2015 can be retrieved from this [web,site](https://figshare.com/collections/FLO1K_global_maps_of_mean_maximum_and_minimum_annual_streamflow_at_1_km_resolution_from_1960_through_2015/3890224){target="_blank"}. FLO1K delivers relevant data for water resources analyses at a global scale and yet high spatial resolution [@barbarossa_2018]. These data can be helpful for long-term water balance assessments and for studying the hydropower potential in the high mountain regions where flow measurements are sparse.

The CHELSA V21 global daily high-resolution climatology, available from 01-01-1979 until 31-12-2011 was processed over the Central Asia domain to map climate trends, including on temperature, precipitation, and snow fraction. The data is available upon request from this site: https://chelsa-climate.org @karger_2017[, @karger_2020, @karger_2021]{target="_blank"}. The CHELSA V21 product is corrected for snow undercatch in the high elevation ranges and thus can represent better actual high mountain precipitation than other available global climatologies [@beck_2020]. The aridity index (AI) fields were taken from the bio-climate CHELSA V21 data set and compared with the CGIAR AI product [@trabucco_2019]. Data on an additional 70 bio-climatic indicators were downloaded from the CHELSA V21 1980 - 2010 climatology, and statistics were extracted for each gauged catchment, together with the AI.

High-resolution crop disaggregated irrigated areas were mapped over the entire Central Asia domain by [hydrosolutions GmbH](www.hydrosolutions.ch){target="_blank"} (see also [@ragettli_2018] for more information). Like this, 30 m crop maps were produced with Google Earth Engine using unsupervised classification for 2016 - 2020. These maps, in conjunction with estimates of irrigation water intake volumes and estimates of actual evapotranspiration help in irrigation scheme performance assessments. In hydrological modeling, these data can be used to introduce sectoral consumption estimates and help develop sound and effective basin planning.
