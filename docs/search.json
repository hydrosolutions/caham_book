    "text": "Theory\nIn this chapter, we examine the definition of a watershed and how it is delineated using Geographic Information System (GIS) and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). We also explore the basics of GIS and the concept of a DEM.\nThe goal of the first exercise is to delineate the catchment, like in the example of upper ZRB in Figure Figure 13.5. For this exercise, you need to have QGIS installed. For a quick installation guide and tutorial, follow this Link. If you already have your catchment outlines and river network, you can skip this exercise and go to sec-basin-characterisation-theory.\nIn this exercise, we will use the Global Watersheds web app by Heberger (2022) for the catchment delineation. The following instruction video shows how to delineate the catchment and import your watershed area and river network into QGIS.\nEnglish version:\nRussian version:\nWatershed delineation can also be performed using other tools such as QGIS, detailed in Chapter ?sec-catchment-delineation, or R, as outlined here."

It is the area draining to a common point. Watershed delineation is creating a boundary representing the contributing area for a particular point/outlet.\n\n\nFigure 13.1: Example of a watershed. Source: The watershed project\n\nHydrological Balance\n\\[\nP + SM - ET - I- Q = 0\n\\tag{13.1}\\]\nWhere \\(P\\) is the precipitation, \\(SM\\) snowmelt, \\(ET\\) evapotranspiration, \\(I\\) infiltration and \\(Q\\) the discharge.\nThe Topography is the main driving force behind watershed delineation. To find the watershed boundary, we need to pick a point (outlet) and find the area draining into it. We do this to select properties within the watershed, as well as the climate forcing."

    "text": "13.3 Coordinate Reference System (CRS)\nTo define the location of objects on the Earth you need a coordinate reference system that adapts to the Earth’s shape. There are two different types of a Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS):\n\nA Geographic coordinate systems (GCS) is a system that uses a three-dimensional spherical surface to determine locations on the Earth. Any location on Earth can be referenced by a point with longitude and latitude coordinates. Its units are angular, usually degrees. (Figure 13.4, right)\nA Projected coordinate system (PCS) is flat. It contains a GCS, but it converts that GCS into a flat surface by projecting points into the plane. Its units are linear, for example, in meters Figure 13.4, left)\n\n\n\nFigure 13.4: Differences of a geographic coordinate system (GCS) left and a projected coordinate system (PCS) right.\n\nThere are many different models of the earth’s surface, and therefore many different GCS. World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) is designed as a one-size-fits-all GCS, good for mapping global data and the most popular CRS. WGS84 uses a three-dimensional ellipsoidal model of the Earth, with positions that are defined using latitude and longitude in degree (e.g. Location of Zurich: E: 47.4°, N: 8.5°).\nThe Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) system is a commonly used projected coordinate reference system, in meter. UTM subdivides the globe into zones, numbered 0-60 (equivalent to longitude) and regions (north and south). A UTM zone is a 6° segment of the Earth. Because a circle has 360°, this means that there are 60 UTM zones on Earth. The coordinate system grid for each zone is projected individually. Additionally, the system includes a series of horizontal bands, each covering 8 degrees of latitude, which are lettered from C to X. Zurich, for example, is in UTM zone 32T with the location: 32T E: 465207.85 N: 5246235.11."

    "text": "13.5 Watershed delineation\nWatersheds can be delineated from a DEM. In this handbook, we look at the point-based watershed delineation. The point-based method derives a watershed for each selected point (e.g. discharge station). The slideshow below shows the steps to delineate a watershed based on the example of the upper Zarafshan River Basin.\nThe outlet point of a watershed is where all the water drains into. Water flow is mainly driven by gravity. From a DEM, we are getting information about the height structure of the surface. To delineate a watershed, first, we have to fill in sinks. A filled DEM is void of depressions, cells that are surrounded by higher elevation values and thus represent an area of internal drainage. From the filled DEM, we can calculate the flow direction. The flow direction shows the direction in which the water will flow out of each cell of the filled DEM. A widely used method for deriving flow direction is the D8 method. The D8 method assigns a cell’s flow direction based on the steepest slope of its eight neighbours. From the flow direction, we can calculate the flow accumulation of each cell by counting how many cells are draining into one cell. The stream network can be derived from a flow accumulation raster by, for example, using a threshold method. This means if a cell of the flow accumulation raster exceeds a certain threshold of how many cells are draining into this cell, it is classified as a river."

We will now edit the attribute table to prepare it for the RSMinerve model. RSMinerve needs an identifier to differentiate between the junctions. We can use the attribute TYPE to uniquely identify the two junctions needed. RSMinerve further needs the ID of the downstream river. Add a column to the attribute table by pressing the Add Field button (see Figure C.50).\n\n\n\nFigure C.50: Edit Attribute table. Step 2: Add a column to the attribute table manually, part 1.\n\n\nDefine a name for the attribute, a type and admissible length of each entry in the Add Field window.

Step 2: Add a column to the attribute table manually, part 2.\n\n\nClose the window by pressing OK. By clicking in the newly created NULL fields, you can now type names for the downstream rivers and save your edits by pressing the save edits icon (3rd from the left in the toolbar of the attribute table window). As the outlet of the catchment goes directly into Charvak reservoir, we can type Charvak as the downstream river ID for this example. The river stretch between junction and outlet is called Pskem (see Figure C.52).\n\n\n\nFigure C.52: Edit Attribute table. Step 2: Add a column to the attribute table manually, part 3.\n\n\nWe are done editing the Junctions layer. Deactivate the edit mode by clicking on the yellow pen in the attribute table window as demonstrated in Figure C.53 and close the window.\n\n\n\nFigure C.53: Save your edits.\n\n\nNow save the Junctions layer in an appropriate place on your drive. Time to save your QGIS project.\nIn the same way you can also edit the river channels layer."

Additional support is also provided in Appendix ?sec-open-resouces-software-QGIS, ?sec-open-resouces-software-R and ?sec-open-resouces-software-RSMinerve. In the beginning, we will need R and QGIS. From the chapter Introduction to Hydrological Modeling, RSMinerve is also needed."

    "text": "13.2 Geographic information system (GIS)\nWe perform all operations in a Geographic Information System (GIS). A GIS allows us to manage, analyse, edit, produce, and visualise geographic data, also known as spatial data. This is data that includes additional location information. Spatial data comes in two forms: vector and raster data.\nVector points are simply X,Y coordinates and can represent a location like a discharge station, for example. A vector line is a connected sequence of points (e. g. river, street). A vector polygon is a closed set of lines, like a watershed boundary.\n\n\nFigure 13.2: Vector vs. raster data in GIS.\n\nRaster data is made up of pixels (also referred to as grid cells). They are usually regularly spaced and square but don’t have to be. Each pixel is associated with a specific geographical location. Examples of raster data are land use and elevation data. The spatial resolution of raster data refers to the cell geometry, how “big” one cell is. Figure 13.3 shows the effect of different spatial resolutions.\n\n\nFigure 13.3: Raster data with different spatial resolution."
