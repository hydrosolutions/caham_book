Then make sure the required software for this course is installed on your computer. Section Open-source resources of the Appendix includes installation instructions and the on-line learning material that can get you started with the software. Below is a quick summary:\n\nQGIS\n\nR\nRStudio\n\nRS Minerve\n\nIf you have not used the software above before we recommend the following resources to get your started (remember, more detailed instructions are available in the Appendix):\n\nQGIS training manual\n\nModern Dive for getting started with R and RStudio\n\nRS Minerve User Manual\n\nInevitably, you will also perform a lot of geocomputations with R in the future. After all, a GIS system like QGIS is nothing more than a nicely packed bunch of geocomputation algorithms and a window for visualizing geospatial assets. Well, rest assured, all of this can be done inside R. It is recommended therefore that you also consult the following excellent online resource Geocomputation with R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK\n\n\n\nFind a peer or two with whom you will work on a basin of your selection. Download the data from the corresponding river basin an\n\n\n\n\nDay 2: Catchment Characterization\nRead the Case Studies in Chapter 3 and Station Data in Chapter 5 and do the exercise on catchment characterization, i.e.Â do a catchment characterization of your sample catchment."
