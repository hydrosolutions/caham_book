# Hydrological-Hydraulic Modeling {#sec-hydraulic-hydrological-modeling}

Hydrological-hydraulic models are used for different purposes, including for the design of basin plans while taking into consideration different development options, for the study of effective water resources management schemes while taking into consideration the different types of sectoral users and uses of water in a basin (ideally also including minimal environmental flows), and for the detailed study of basin-scale climate impacts and their repercussions.

This Chapter introduces combined hydrologic and hydraulic modeling using the freely available graphical modeling environment RSMinerve [@rsminerve_software; @rsminerve_um; @rsminerve_tm][^rs_minerve-1]. @fig-rsminervemodelpreview shows a screen shot of a model of the Gunt river basin setup in RSMinerve as a teaser.

[^rs_minerve-1]: The reader is advised to consult the user manual and familiarizes themselves with the walk through examples that are discussed and presented there. They give a solid first hands-on introduction about the basic functionalities of the modeling environment.

It should be noted that other modeling packages exist for hydrological-hydraulic modeling. Among others, these include

-   [WEAP: Water Evaluation and Planning System](https://www.weap21.org){target="_blank"},
-   [SWAT: Soil & Water Assessment Tool](https://swat.tamu.edu){target="_blank"}, and
-   [Mike Hydro Basin](https://www.mikepoweredbydhi.com/products/mike-hydro-basin){target="_blank"}

As some if not most of these modeling packages are license-based, the advantage of using the combination of [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/), [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RSMinerve](https://www.crealp.ch/fr/accueil/outils-services/logiciels/rs-minerve.html) is that this is a completely free software suit for any user and use scenario.

Departing from catchment GIS data, RS Minerve allows to quickly develop, test and calibrate different types of lumped conceptual precipitation runoff models while taking into account the evolution of water balances in glacier, snow, surface and subsurface compartments over time and in different sections in the catchment under consideration. This is demonstrated here for the Gunt River Basin in the Pamirs (see Chapter \@ref(GuntRB) for more information).

The main goal in this Chapter is to familiarize the student on how to setup such model, calibrate and validate it for past and current climate conditions and then to **study climate change impacts in the basin**.



## Prerequisites {#section-rsminerve-prerequisites}
Before delving into this section of the course material, you should have at least:   

* RS Minerve installed [How to install RS Minerve](#section-quickguides-how-to-download-and-install-rsminerve). This tutorial was written using RS Minerve 2.9.1.0. 
* Read chapters 1 and 2 from the RS Minerve user manual [@rsminerve_um] (the manual can be downloaded from the CREALP website, see Section [How to install RS Minerve](#section-quickguides-how-to-download-and-install-rsminerve)).    
* Familiarize yourself with RS Minerve by following Example 1 in the RS Minerve user manual.  
* Read the HBV model description in the RS Minerve technical manual (Chapter 2.7) [@rsminerve_tm].   

You may have to dig deeper into the user manual and the technical manual within the frame of the course but the above points are the minimum requirement to get started.   
If you fulfill the prerequisites, you should be able to do the tutorial with the minimal description in the modeling section. However, detailed step-by-step descriptions are linked for each task. 


## The general modeling process {#section-general-modelling-process}
Hydrological modeling is an iterative process (see @fig-iterative-modelling-process). At the beginning, the purpose of the model has to be defined. The model goal determines the spatial and temporal resolution of the hydrological model. E.g. for analyzing the impact of climate change on seasonal, regional flows we are interested in the seasonal flow volumes whereas a model used for early warnings from floods requires high temporal resolution and a high model performance for threshold overflows. See for example @bloschl_scale_1995 for a thorough discussion of scales in hydrological modeling. Please note that the definition of the model goal also determines the performance criteria the model has to fulfill in order to be judged suitable for its purpose. As a next step, data about the catchment is gathered (see for example basin characterization in the Chapter [Case Studies](#CaseStudies)) and a first conceptual model of the dominant flow processes in the basin is drafted (e.g. low peaks and significant base flow point to large storage capacity in the basin whereas high peaks and low base flow indicate small storage capacity in the basin). The conceptual model of the river catchment is then implemented with a mathematical model (e.g. the HBV model in RS Minerve) and parameterized as well as possible (i.e. using reasonable estimates for initial parameter values). The model is then calibrated and validated (i.e. tested with a previously unseen data set) as described further below If the performance criteria for the model calibration are satisfied, a conscientious modeler performs a sensitivity analysis to gain confidence in the model. From each of these steps, the modeler can (and generally has to) go back to a previous step to gather more data, modify the conceptual model, adapt the model implementation, re-calibrate the model and/or re-evaluate the model sensitivity. Also, the modeler is aware of the inherent uncertainties of the data and the model (see for example @refsgaard_uncertainty_2007 for a discussion on how to include uncertainties in the modeling process). The described steps produce a model (or an ensemble of models) that satisfy the performance criteria, only now the modeler can start actually using the model for the purpose it was implemented for.

```

Modeling is an involved process requiring highly specialized knowledge and skills. A modeler has the responsibility to clearly state the underlying assumptions, uncertainties and limitations of their model, especially if it is to be used in decision making. This book chapter will guide you through the modeling process with the example of the Nauvalisoy catchment.  

## The most simple model - the linear reservoir model {#section-rsminerve-why-model-introduction}
Why do we do hydrological modeling? Typically we want to know how much river flow we can expect at a given time in the future so we can plan our water consumption ahead, harness against floods or implement measures against droughts. So how can we forecast river discharge? For example, one could use the long term seasonal average discharge as the likely future discharge. However, in some years we have high discharge and in some years we have low discharge (@fig-discharge-nauvalisoy). How to tell when you have which discharge?

```{r}
#| label: fig-discharge-nauvalisoy
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| error: false
#| fig-cap: "Seasonal discharge of the Nauvalisoy river illustrating the variability of the discharge."
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(tsibble)
library(riversCentralAsia)

seasonal_discharge <- ChirchikRiverBasin |>
  dplyr::filter(code == "16298", 
                year(date) > 1984, 
                year(date) < 1993) |>
  mutate(yearmonth = yearmonth(date)) |>
  group_by(yearmonth) |>
  summarize(`Q [m3/s]` = mean(data))

ggplot(seasonal_discharge) + 
  geom_line(aes(yearmonth, `Q [m3/s]` * 60*60*24*365*10^(-6))) + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Q [10^6 m3/a]") + 
  ylim(0, 500) + 
  theme_bw()
```

Let's go back to the water balance: Where does the water in the river come from? Precipitation. When we compare precipitation and discharge time series we see that the two are related (@fig-precipitation-nauvalisoy).    

```{r}
#| label: fig-precipitation-nauvalisoy
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| error: false
#| fig-cap: "Discharge (red) and precipitation (grey) in the Nauvalisoy catchment."

climate <- load_minerve_input_csv("../caham_data/SyrDarya/Chirchiq/RSMinerve/ERA5_Nauvalisoy_1981_2013.csv")

seasonal_precipitation <- mutate(climate, yearmonth = yearmonth(date)) |>
 dplyr::filter(type == "P") |>
 group_by(yearmonth) |>
 summarize(`P [mm]` = sum(value)) |>
 dplyr::filter(year(yearmonth) > 1984,
               year(yearmonth) < 1993)

ggplot(seasonal_precipitation) +
 geom_col(aes(yearmonth, `P [mm]`), fill = "gray") +
 geom_line(data = seasonal_discharge,
           aes(yearmonth, `Q [m3/s]` * 60*60*24*365*10^(-6))) +
 labs(x = "", y = "P [mm], Q [10^6 m3/a]") +
 ylim(0, 500) + 
 theme_bw()
```

Higher precipitation in the catchment is positively correlated with higher discharge in the river with a delay. Or in other words: The discharge is the catchments hydrological response to precipitation. The relationship is can be expressed as follows: 

$$
Q \propto P \cdot K
$$    

In words this reads: Discharge (Q) is proportional to precipitation (P) times a transfer function (K) that defines the delay of the signal. The transfer function K describes how precipitation becomes river discharge and depends on the catchment characteristics, importantly on the storage capacity of the catchment. In reality, the transformation of precipitation to discharge is quite complex but we can simplify the reality and come up with a basic conceptual model of our river catchment: a large bath tube with the area of the catchment and an outlet at the bottom called the *linear reservoir model* (@fig-from-catchment-to-bucket).  

```{r}
#| label: fig-from-catchment-to-bucket
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "From the real-life system (left) to a linear reservoir (right)."
knitr::include_graphics("images/hydrological_modeling/fig_fromCatchmentToBucket.png")
```

The linear reservoir model describes the discharge from the reservoir as linearly proportional to the storage in the reservoir:   

$$
Q(t) = 1/k \cdot S(t)
$$

Where Q is discharge, S is the storage and k is a constant called storage coefficient depending on the storage capacity of the reservoir. If k is small, the stored water will run out quickly, if k is large, the stored water will run out slowly. (t) indicate time dependent variables, i.e. variables that change over time.   
Substitute the linear reservoir equation into the water balance:  

$$
P = Q + dS/dt \Leftrightarrow P = Q + k \cdot dQ/dt
$$

Where P is the *excess* precipitation, i.e. the precipitation that is not intercepted by plants or ponds but contributes to discharge. The above is a differential equation and can be re-arranged:  

$$(P-Q) \cdot dt = k \cdot dQ$$

and integrated and solved for Q(t) (dig out your mathematics!). In the example in the box below we discretized the water balance with the linear relationship between discharge and storage change in the reservoir:

$$\frac{P_{t_1}+P_{t_1}}{2} - \frac{Q_{t1}+Q_{t_2}}{2} = \frac{k}{t_2-t_1} \cdot (Q_{t_2}-Q_{t_1})$$
and solved the equation for $Q_{t_2}$ (Inspiration from @Pedersen1980).   
We assume that at the beginning of our experiment, we don't have a discharge as the bucket is empty.   

$$Q(t) = P(t) \cdot (1-e^{(-t/k)})$$

This is the equation for the rising discharge curve. Once you turn off the recharge of the reservoir (once you stop pouring water into the bucket), the discharge from the bucket can be described as:  

$$Q(t) = Q^* \cdot e^{-\tau/k}$$

Which describes the receding limb of the hydrograph ([What is a hydrograph](#section-quickguides-what-is-a-hydrograph)) with $\tau$ being the time since the recharge stopped. 

Understanding the linear reservoir model is the first steping stone to hydrological modeling as many concenptual models build up on linear reservoirs. 


## The HBV model {#section-hbv-model}
The HBV (Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenavdelning) model is a conceptual rainfall-runoff model which is suitable for many snow-fed river catchments [@bergstrom_development_1976; @lindstrom_development_1997]. We recommend you to study the short description of the HBV model in the RS Minerve technical manual [@rsminerve_tm]. Keep these 4 pages at hand for the following exercises so you can look up how the parameters influence the flow of water through the HBV model. A brief reminder of the HBV model implemented in RS Minerve is given in @fig-overview-hbv-model.  
In RSMinerve, the catchment area is typically sub-divided into areas with similar hydrological properties, so called hydrological response units or HRUs, for which the discharge is computed individually. Several HRUs can be connected. This approach is often numerically more efficient than a gridded discretization of the catchment area.          

```{r}
#| label: fig-overview-hbv-model
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "The HBV model concept (source: RS MINERVE Technical Manual)."
knitr::include_graphics("images/hydrological_modeling/fig_HBVconceptualModel.png")
```

Water enters the HBV model in the form of precipitation $P$, which is a model forcing provided by the user. Precipitation is separated into solid (snow fall $SF$) and liquid (rainfall $RF$) depending on the termperature $T$, the second model forcing provided by the user. The uppermost component of the HBV model is the snow model (the two top-most blue reservoirs in @fig-overview-hbv-model). A degree-day-melt model melts snow and refreezes water ($M_{sn}$).  
The rainfall plus the snow melt are accumulated to the precipitation equivalent $P_{eq}$ which enters the uppermost soil layer represented in HBV by the soil humidity reservoir of the root zone. This non-linear reservoir represents the loss of water to direct evaporation and to plant evaporation. Potential evaporation $ETP$ thereby is another model forcing, albeit optional, as it can be provided by the user or calculated based on temperature and latitude by RS Minerve.  
Water that is not evaporated or held in the root zone is recharged to deeper soil layers, the upper reservoir. The upper reservoir constitutes the unsaturated zone below the root zone and produces the direct runoff or near-surface runoff ($Q_r$) that occurs when the soils are saturated and the interflow ($Q_u$) which is a lateral discharge in the unsaturated zone.  
Through deep percolation ($i_{Perc}$) water reaches the lower reservoir which corresponds to the saturated zone, the groundwater layer, and produces the baseflow or the lateral discharge of groundwater ($Q_l$). By the way, the lower reservoir is very similar to the linear reservoir discussed above with the exception of an upper storage limit ($SL$).  

The several reservoirs of the HBV model come with a multitude of parameters (@fig-overview-hbv-model-parameters) which have to be adjusted such that the model reproduces the measured discharge of the basin, a process called model calibration which will be discussed in more detail further on in this chapter. Here we'd like you to note the number of model states and parameters or degrees of freedom the HBV model has and to compare it to the amount of measurements of model states that is actually available to constrain the model parameters.  

```{r}
#| label: fig-overview-hbv-model-parameters
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "The HBV model parameters (source RS MINERVE Technical Manual)."
knitr::include_graphics("images/hydrological_modeling/fig_PARandIC.png")
```

In the HBV model, 6 parameters need to be constrained alone for the snow model (@fig-overview-hbv-model-parameters). Typically, measurements of the states of the model reservoirs ($SWE$ and $WH$, $Hum$, $SU$, $SL$) are not available. Thus, more often than not, parameters of hydrological models are solely calibrated based on the aggregated total discharge of a basin. A lot of care should be given to trying to constrain the model parameters using combinations of different approaches:  

* Minimize the number of parameters in your model   
    This is done by fixing the least sensitive parameters to literature values
* Compare to parameter values from the literature for similar catchments
* Look for data sets that may be used to calibrate parts of the model
* Do not only minimize the error between the measured and the simulated discharge but look at all the models states and fluxes and make sure they are physically meaningful


Luckily, research into suitable data products to further constrain hydrological models.   

The simulated snow water equivalent may be compared to the snow water equivalend available from the High Mountain Asia Snow Reanalysis product so one variable can be used to . Water storage in the root zone, the soil or in the lower reservoirs are generally not available thus the  


## The RS Minerve modelling environment
The reader should already be familiar with RS Minerve through completion of example 1 in the RS Minerve user guide. The following paragraphs demonstrate how to automatically implement a hydrological model in RS Minerve using an example basin from Central Asia. The basin of the river Chon Kemin hereby serves as a demonstration site.    

### Loading GIS data
Open RS Minerve and move to the GIS tab (1). Click on the Add Layers button in the top right corner of the menu bar (2). An explorer window will pop-up where you select the layers you want to load (3). You require the HRU, junction and river layers which have been prepared for you in the student case study pack. 

![Loading GIS data in RS Minerve.](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_loadGISdata_01.png){#fig-rsm-load-gis-data-01}
Click Open (4) to close the explorer window and to load the selected GIS layers into RS Minerve. The result is shown in @fig-rsm-load-gis-data-02. 

![GIS data loaded in RS Minerve](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_loadGISdata_02.png){#fig-rsm-load-gis-data-02}

RS Minerve offers limited GIS utilities. You can, for example, change the colors of the GIS layers in the layer properties. The usage is similar to QGIS. You can further inspect the layer attributes by selecting a layer (1) and clicking the Table Info button (2) to open the attribute table. 

![View the attribute table of an example layer in RS Minerve.](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_loadGISdata_03.png){#fig-rsm-load-gis-data-03}

### Automatic model generation
To automatically generate the model structure, make sure, the 3 required GIS layers are loaded (section above), then click on the Creation button in the Model Management toolbox (1). The model creation configuration window will pop up where you select the appropriate attributes for each model layer from the drop-down menus (2, 4). Tick the Altitude (Z) option in the Subbasins properties and select the Z attribute (3) to let RS Minerve know the altitude of each HRU.  

![Configuration of the model creation utilities. Selecting the appropriate attributes from the GIS layers.](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_autoModelCreation_01.png){#fig-rsm-auto-model-creation-01}
Then select all sub-basins in the Allocate SubBasins Type window (5) and click on the model object selector (6). 

Select the HBV model (1) and click the Allocate Subbasins button (2). 

![Configuration of the model creation utilities. Selecting hydrological models for each HRU.](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_autoModelCreation_02.png){#fig-rsm-auto-model-creation-02}
All the sub-basins should now display the red HBV icon (@fig-rsm-auto-model-creation-03). 

Next, select the river stretch ChonKemin (1), select the Kinematic Wave in the drop-down menu (2) and press Allocate Rivers (3). The icon of the rivers sections should subsequently be colored in the Kindematic Wave colours (not shown). 

![Configuration of the model creation utilities. Selecting hydrodynamic stream flow models for each river section.](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_autoModelCreation_03.png){#fig-rsm-auto-model-creation-03}
Finally, press the Create Model button in the lower right corner of the RS Minerve window (4). If the model creation process is successful, the message ***Creation model finished.*** appears in the lower left corner of the RS Minerve window (5). If the model creation process is not successful, an error message will appear instead at the same location which will support you in identifying the problem. 

You can now switch to the Model tab and look at the automatically generated model layout (@fig-rsm-auto-model-creation-04). 

![Automatically generated model layout of the Chon Kemin catchment.](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_autoModelCreation_04.png){#fig-rsm-auto-model-creation-04}

The river stretch is no longer required. Delete it by selecting it with a left-click on the river object and then pressing delete in the Editing Tools menu in the header bar. 

You can beautify the model view by loading a background image of the Chon Kemin catchment (for example a screen shot from QGIS, @fig-rsm-auto-model-creation-05) and by re-arranging the HRUs (click and drag) and climate stations for better readability. 

![Load a background image into RS Minerve by clicking Background (1) Load (2) , selecting the image (3) and pressing Open (4). Exit the background image editing mode by clicking (1) again.](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_autoModelCreation_05.png){#fig-rsm-auto-model-creation-05}

Now we need to add a comparator and a source object in order to be able to compare the simulated river discharge to the observed discharge. Step-by-step you need to click on the Source object in the model object list (1). A small faucet icon will appear en lieu of your customary cursor icon. Move your cursor to an appropriate location in the map window and click to place the source object (2). Do the same for the comparator object: activate it by clicking the object (3) and place it with a click in the map window (4).

![Adding source and comparator object to the model layout.](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_autoModelCreation_06.png){#fig-rsm-auto-model-creation-06}

The new objects now need to be connected to the rest of the model objects. Activate the Connections mode in the Editing tools box of the header bar (5). Then draw a line from the source object to the comparator object (6). In the pop-up window, specify that the source object is your reference (7). Then accknowledge by clicking Ok.  

In the same manner, draw a connection from the junction object (15149_gauge) to the comparator (1) and specify that the junction represents your simulated discharge (2). 

![Connecting the new objects to the rest of the model objects.](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_autoModelCreation_07.png){#fig-rsm-auto-model-creation-07}

Deactivate the connection mode by clicking the Select button (3). You can re-name the new objects by clicking on their names. The basic model layout is now finished but there are still a few required steps before we can run the model. 

### Loading climate data
The hydrological model needs forcing data: Precipitation and Temperature. The following sections illustrate how to load the pre-processed climate data into RS Minerve. 

Navigate to the Database tab (1) and click the Open button (2). This opens an explorer pop-up window where you choose csv files in the drop-down menu (3) and then select the file hist_obs_rsm.csv. Close the explorer window by pressing the Open button (hidden beneath the drop-down menu in @fig-rsm-load-db-01).

![Loading climate forcing into RS Minerve](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_loadDatabase_01.png){#fig-rsm-load-db-01}
In the navigation window on the left, a data base icon will appear. Explore the Database by clicking on the triangle next to the icon. You can display the data in the data base by clicking on the Sensors (1), typically T, P and Q, in the navigation window. A time series plot will then appear in the main window. You can also explore the data in the table format by switching to the Values tab (2). 

![Visualizing data base.](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_loadDatabase_012.png){#fig-rsm-load-db-012}
Note the time range of the forcing data (from Jan 1, 1979 0:00 to Dec. 21, 2011 0:00). The time range of the forcing determines the time range of the simulation. Also note the time interval between the data (daily data for the forcing and decadal data for the discharge).

Click on ***New group*** (1, not visible because the name is already changed in @fig-rsm-load-db-02) and change the name of the group to Climate (2). In the dropdown menu select Input for the data category (3).  

![Loading climate forcing into RS Minerve](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_loadDatabase_02.png){#fig-rsm-load-db-02}

We now move the discharge time series to a separate data group: Select Database (1) then click Add (2). A new group appears at the bottom of the data list (3). Select New group (3) and change the name (4) to Discharge and select Input from the dropdown menu (5).  

![Loading climate forcing into RS Minerve](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_loadDatabase_03.png){#fig-rsm-load-db-03}

Navigate to the discharge time series Q (1) and do a right-click. In the pop-up window that appears select Cut (2). 

![Cut the discharge time series from the climate data group.](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_loadDatabase_04.png){#fig-rsm-load-db-04}

Select Discharge (1) and click Add (2) to add a new data set (3). Right-click on New Dataset and select Paste to put the discharge sensor data at the new location. You can rename New Dataset.  

![Paste the discharge time series to the discharge data group.](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_loadDatabase_05.png){#fig-rsm-load-db-05}

The database is now ready, next we need to link the data to the model objects. Navigate to the Model tab. Under Data source select the appropriate data groups for the station data objects and for the source objects (1) and select the appropriate Dataset (2). The names in the database tab should already be consistent with the ones in the objects and the linking for the weather stations works automatically. 

![Linking the database to the model objects and time configuration.](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_loadDatabase_06.png){#fig-rsm-load-db-06}
Then adapt the Start and End of the simulation period (4). Start cannot be earlier than the first forcing in the database and End cannot be later than the last forcing in the database. The simulation period can, however, be shorter than the forcing time series. The simulation time step is 1 day and the recording time step is 1 month (4).  

The for the linking of the discharge data with the source we still need to double-click on the source object in the  map (1) and select Q * Q in the drop-down menu (3). 

![Linking the discharge with the source object](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_loadDatabase_07.png){#fig-rsm-load-db-07}

### Configuration
Last but not least we need to tell RS Minerve to compute the evaporation flux for us. This step needs to be done only once for each model and is described in the [Quick guide](@sec-quickguides-atapt-model-settings). Don't forget to save your model. 

### First model run
Now click Validation (1) to let RS Minerve test if the model is valid. 

![Validation of the model.](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_firstModelRun_01.png){#fig-rsm-first-run-01}
In case the model is valid it will say so in the lower left corner of the RS Minerve window (2). A more detailed report appears in the output window on the right (3). The warning can be ignored as the discharge of the source is not a required input for the model simulation.  

Now press Start (1). The simulation is done fairly quickly. With a double-click on the comparator object in the center window the output window fills with a lot of information. The Results table shows a number of indicators of model goodness. Please read Chapter 3 on the performance indicators in the technical manual [@rsminerve_tm] for the equations of each indicator. Here we will only briefly mention the most commonly encountered:  

The root mean squared error (RSME) ranges from 0 to $\infty$ and should be minimized.

The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (Nash) ranges from -$\infty$ to 1 and should be maximized. Nash of 0 means that the model has the same performance as the average of the measured data. 

![First model run.](images/hydrological_modeling/rsm_firstModelRun_02.png){#fig-rsm-first-run-02}

The graph (4) shows the measured discharge in blue (QReference) and the simulated discharge in green (QSimulation).   

Note that QSimulation starts with 0. This is because RS Minerve initializes the initial water content of the HBV modules with 0 unless something else is specified. You should click Conditions on Dec. 12, 2011 (2), apply and re-run the model to obtain a properly initialized model. 

The model produces the correct seasonality but the water balance is way off. We fix this by calibrating the model. This is a big task and will be treated in the next chapter.  


## Model calibration
The large number of parameters of the HBV model can be adjusted within reasonable ranges to make the simulated river discharge more similar to the measured discharge. This process is sometimes called history matching because past or historical measurements are used to adapt the model parameters.
