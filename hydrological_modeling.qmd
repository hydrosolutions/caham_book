# Part III: Hydrological Modeling & Applications {#sec-hydrological-modeling}

This part of the book focusses on different types of hydrological modeling approaches and applications. The [Chapter on hydrological modeling using rainfall-runoff models](#sec-hydraulic-hydrological-modeling) introduces in a hands-on manner modeling using the free-tu-use [RSMinerve Software Suite](https://www.crealp.ch/fr/accueil/outils-services/logiciels/rs-minerve.html){target="_blank"}. These types of models are foundational for example for basin planning exercises where tradeoffs between water for different sectoral allocations need to be quantified in a specific context. 

Such models are also important for detailed climate impact studies regularly used to study these. The idea is simple, i.e., to use available climate model output over the 21^st^ century as forcing and investigate changes in the hydrographs at stations of interest over time. When different models and scenarios are run, an band of uncertainty can be specified which is relevant in any decision-making context. 

Finally, the design of hydropower infrastructure depends on hydrological assessments with such types of models. The model outputs, i.e., simulated (modelled) discharge at a particular location, can be used to compute cummulative flow duration curves which are essential for the assessment of the hydropower potential and critically inform infrastructure sizing.

The relevance of these types of models for the water planners and managers in the global drylands cannot be overstated and therefore, one of the primary goals of this course is to familiarze the students well with such types of models.

The [Chapter on long-term hydrological modeling using the Budyko framework](#sec-budyko-modeling) looks at the greater semi-arid Central Asia region as compared to individual catchments. It is at this scale and over a large number of smaller catchments where interesting steady-state patterns of the partioning of available water into evporation and runoff can be studied, under current and future climate states. Among other applications, such types of models can help to inform the large-scale questions, also with regard to the current and future inter-state water distribution.

Finally, the [Chapter on time series modeling using predictive inference](#sec-modeling-using-predictive-inference) discusses models
