	abstract = {{Sound water resources planning and management requires adequate data with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. This is especially true in the context of irrigated agriculture, which is one of the main consumptive users of the world's freshwater resources. Existing remote sensing methods for the management of irrigated agricultural systems are often based on empirical cropland data that are difficult to obtain, and that put into question the transferability of mapping algorithms in space and time. Here we implement an automatic irrigation mapping procedure in Google Earth Engine that uses surface reflectance satellite imagery from different sensors. The method is based on unsupervised training of a pixel-by-pixel classification algorithm within image regions identified through unsupervised object-based segmentation, followed by multi-temporal image analysis to distinguish productive irrigated fields from non-productive and non-irrigated areas. Ground-based data are not required. The final output of the mapping algorithm are monthly and annual irrigation maps (30 m resolution). The novel method is applied to the Central Asian Chu and Talas River Basins that are shared between upstream Kyrgyzstan and downstream Kazakhstan. We calculate the development of irrigated areas from 2000 to 2017 and assess the classification results in terms of robustness and accuracy. Based on seven available validation scenes (in total more than 2.5 million pixels) the classification accuracy is 77--96\%. We show that on the Kyrgyz side of the Talas basin, the identified increasing trends over the years are highly significant (23\% area increase between 2000 and 2017). In the Kazakh parts of the basins the irrigated acreages are relatively stable over time, but the average irrigation frequency within Soviet-era irrigation perimeters is very low, which points to a poor physical condition of the irrigation infrastructure and inadequate water supply.}},

@article{barbarossa_2018,
	abstract = {Streamflow data is highly relevant for a variety of socio-economic as well as ecological analyses or applications, but a high-resolution global streamflow dataset is yet lacking. We created FLO1K, a consistent streamflow dataset at a resolution of 30 arc seconds (\~{}1 km) and global coverage. FLO1K comprises mean, maximum and minimum annual flow for each year in the period 1960--2015, provided as spatially continuous gridded layers. We mapped streamflow by means of artificial neural networks (ANNs) regression. An ensemble of ANNs were fitted on monthly streamflow observations from 6600 monitoring stations worldwide, i.e., minimum and maximum annual flows represent the lowest and highest mean monthly flows for a given year. As covariates we used the upstream-catchment physiography (area, surface slope, elevation) and year-specific climatic variables (precipitation, temperature, potential evapotranspiration, aridity index and seasonality indices). Confronting the maps with independent data indicated good agreement (R2 values up to 91{\%}). FLO1K delivers essential data for freshwater ecology and water resources analyses at a global scale and yet high spatial resolution.},

This paper presents the development of the global database through systematic digitisation of satellite imagery globally by a small team and highlights the various approaches to bias estimation and to validation of the data. The following datasets are provided (a) raw digitised coordinates for the location of dam walls (that may be useful for example in machine learning approaches to dam identification from imagery), (b) a global vector file of the watershed for each dam.},

@article{hugonnet_accelerated_2021,
	abstract = {Glaciers distinct from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are shrinking rapidly, altering regional hydrology1, raising global sea level2 and elevating natural hazards3. Yet, owing to the scarcity of constrained mass loss observations, glacier evolution during the satellite era is known only partially, as a geographic and temporal patchwork4,5. Here we reveal the accelerated, albeit contrasting, patterns of glacier mass loss during the early twenty-first century. Using largely untapped satellite archives, we chart surface elevation changes at a high spatiotemporal resolution over all of Earth's glaciers. We extensively validate our estimates against independent, high-precision measurements and present a globally complete and consistent estimate of glacier mass change. We show that during 2000--2019, glaciers lost a mass of 267 $\pm$ 16 gigatonnes per year, equivalent to 21 $\pm$ 3 per cent of the observed sea-level rise6. We identify a mass loss acceleration of 48 $\pm$ 16 gigatonnes per year per decade, explaining 6 to 19 per cent of the observed acceleration of sea-level rise. Particularly, thinning rates of glaciers outside ice sheet peripheries doubled over the past two decades. Glaciers currently lose more mass, and at similar or larger acceleration rates, than the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets taken separately7--9. By uncovering the patterns of mass change in many regions, we find contrasting glacier fluctuations that agree with the decadal variability in precipitation and temperature. These include a North Atlantic anomaly of decelerated mass loss, a strongly accelerated loss from northwestern American glaciers, and the apparent end of the Karakoram anomaly of mass gain10. We anticipate our highly resolved estimates to advance the understanding of drivers that govern the distribution of glacier change, and to extend our capabilities of predicting these changes at all scales. Predictions robustly benchmarked against observations are critically needed to design adaptive policies for the local- and regional-scale management of water resources and cryospheric risks, as well as for the global-scale mitigation of sea-level rise.},

We apply the method to the ERA5 precipitation archive and MODIS monthly cloud cover frequency to develop a daily gridded precipitation time series in 1 km resolution for the years 2003 onward. Comparison of the predictions with existing gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network indicates an improvement in the spatio-temporal performance of the downscaled data in predicting precipitation. Regional scrutiny of the cloud cover correction from the continental United States further indicates that CHELSA-EarthEnv performs well in comparison to other precipitation products. The CHELSA-EarthEnv daily precipitation product improves the temporal accuracy compared with a large improvement in the spatial accuracy especially in complex terrain.}},

Here we present the CHELSA (Climatologies at high resolution for the earth's land surface areas) data of downscaled model output temperature and precipitation estimates of the ERA-Interim climatic reanalysis to a high resolution of 30 arc sec. The temperature algorithm is based on statistical downscaling of atmospheric temperatures. The precipitation algorithm incorporates orographic predictors including wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. The resulting data consist of a monthly temperature and precipitation climatology for the years 1979-2013. We compare the data derived from the CHELSA algorithm with other standard gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network. We compare the performance of the new climatologies in species distribution modelling and show that we can increase the accuracy of species range predictions. We further show that CHELSA climatological data has a similar accuracy as other products for temperature, but that its predictions of precipitation patterns are better.}},

Here, we present monthly time series data on precipitation, minimum- and maximum temperature for four downscaled global circulation models. We used model output statistics in combination with mechanistic downscaling (the CHELSA algorithm) to calculate mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as monthly precipitation at \textbackslashtextasciitilde5 km spatial resolution globally for the years 2006--2100. We validated the performance of the downscaling algorithm by comparing model output with the observed climate of the historical period 1950--1969.}},

@article{ARORA2002164,
	abstract = {Available energy (often expressed in terms of potential evaporation) and precipitation largely determine annual evapotranspiration and runoff rates in a region. The ratio of annual potential evaporation to precipitation, referred to as the aridity index by Budyko, has been shown to describe the evaporation ratio (the ratio of annual evapotranspiration to precipitation) of catchments from a range of climatic regimes in a number of studies. It has been shown that aridity index alone can be used to obtain an estimate of ratio of standard deviation of annual evapotranspiration estimates to that of precipitation (the evaporation deviation ratio). At present, there are at least five functional forms available, which describe evaporation ratio as a function of aridity index. This study assesses data from Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis' (CCCma) third-generation atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) against these five functional forms. Evaporation ratio and evaporation deviation ratios from an AGCM simulation are compared against these five functional forms and it is shown that the primary control of available energy and precipitation over annual partitioning of precipitation, and interannual variability of evapotranspiration, is preserved well in the AGCM. The aridity index is further used to obtain an analytic equation, which can be used to estimate change in runoff given annual changes in precipitation and available energy. This equation is validated using data from control and climate change simulations of the CCCma coupled GCM (CGCM1) and shown to perform fairly well. The correlation between CGCM1 simulated annual change in runoff and the values obtained using aridity index is consistently around 0.95, and the average bias varies between 40.5 and 50.3mm/year, for the five functional forms. The successful validation of this equation against data from a GCM climate change simulation illustrates the continued relevance of aridity index, and the primary control of precipitation and available energy in determining annual evapotranspiration and runoff rates.},

	abstract = {{The Budyko equation has achieved iconic status in hydrology for its concise and accurate representation of the relationship between annual evapotranspiration and long-term-average water and energy balance at catchment scales. Accelerating anthropogenic land-use and climate change have sparked a renewed interest in predictive applications of the Budyko equation to analyze future scenarios important to water resource management. These applications, in turn, have inspired a number of attempts to derive mathematical models of the Budyko equation from a variety of specific assumptions about the original Budyko hypothesis. Here, we show that the Budyko equation and all extant models of it can be derived rigorously from a single mathematical assumption concerning the Budyko hypothesis. The implications of this fact for parametric models of the Budyko equation also are explored.}},

	abstract = {{A warmer climate may lead to less precipitation falling as snow in cold seasons. Such a switch in the state of precipitation not only alters temporal distribution of intra-annual runoff but also tends to yield less total annual runoff. Long-term water balance for 282 catchments across China is investigated, showing that a decreasing snow ratio reduces annual runoff for a given total precipitation. Within the Budyko framework, we develop an equation to quantify the relationship between snow ratio and annual runoff from a water--energy balance viewpoint. Based on the proposed equation, attribution of runoff change during the past several decades and possible runoff change induced by projected snow ratio change using climate experiment outputs archived in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are analyzed. Results indicate that annual runoff in northwestern mountainous and northern high-latitude areas are sensitive to snow ratio change. The proposed model is applicable to other catchments easily and quantitatively for analyzing the effects of possible change in snow ratio on available water resources and evaluating the vulnerability of catchments to climate change.}},
