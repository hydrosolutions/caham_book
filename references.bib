	abstract = {Seasonal snowpack is an essential component in the hydrological cycle and plays a significant role in supplying water resources to downstream users. Yet the snow water equivalent ({SWE}) in seasonal snowpacks, and its space-time variation, remains highly uncertain, especially over mountainous areas with complex terrain and sparse observations, such as 10 in High-Mountain Asia ({HMA}). In this work, we assessed the spatiotemporal distribution of seasonal {SWE}, obtained from a new 18-year {HMA} Snow Reanalysis ({HMASR}) dataset, as part of the recent {NASA} High-Mountain Asia Team ({HiMAT}) effort. A Bayesian snow reanalysis scheme previously developed to assimilate satellite derived fractional snow-covered area ({fSCA}) products from Landsat and {MODIS} platforms has been applied to develop the {HMASR} dataset (at a spatial resolution of 16 arc-second ({\textasciitilde}500 m) and daily temporal resolution) over the joint Landsat-{MODIS} period covering Water 15 Years ({WYs}) 2000-2017. Based on the results, the {HMA}-wide total {SWE} volume is found to be around 163 km3 on average and ranges from 114 km3 ({WY}2001) to 227 km3 ({WY}2005) when assessed over 18 {WYs}. The most abundant snowpacks are found in the northwestern basins (e.g. Indus, Syr Darya and Amu Darya) that are mainly affected by the westerlies, accounting for around 66\% of total seasonal {SWE} volume. When examining the elevational distribution over the {HMA} domain, seasonal {SWE} volume peaks at mid-elevations (around 3500 m), with over 50\% of the volume stored above 3500 20 m. This work brings new insight into understanding the climatology and variability of seasonal snowpack over {HMA}, with the regional snow reanalysis constrained by remote sensing data, providing a new reference dataset for future studies of seasonal snow and how it contributes to the water cycle and climate over the {HMA} region.},

	abstract = {Glaciers in High Mountain Asia generate meltwater that supports the water needs of 250
million people, but current knowledge of annual accumulation and ablation is limited to
sparse field measurements biased in location and glacier size. Here, we present altitudinallyresolved specific mass balances (surface, internal, and basal combined) for 5527 glaciers in
High Mountain Asia for 2000–2016, derived by correcting observed glacier thinning patterns
for mass redistribution due to ice flow. We find that 41\% of glaciers accumulated mass over
less than 20\% of their area, and only 60\% ± 10\% of regional annual ablation was compensated by accumulation. Even without 21st century warming, 21\% ± 1\% of ice volume will
be lost by 2100 due to current climatic-geometric imbalance, representing a reduction in
glacier ablation into rivers of 28\% ± 1\%. The ablation of glaciers in the Himalayas and Tien
Shan was mostly unsustainable and ice volume in these regions will reduce by at least 30\%
by 2100. The most important and vulnerable glacier-fed river basins (Amu Darya, Indus, Syr
Darya, Tarim Interior) were supplied with {\textgreater}50\% sustainable glacier ablation but will see longterm reductions in ice mass and glacier meltwater supply regardless of the Karakoram

	abstract = {Glaciers distinct from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are shrinking rapidly, altering regional hydrology1, raising global sea level2 and elevating natural hazards3. Yet, owing to the scarcity of constrained mass loss observations, glacier evolution during the satellite era is known only partially, as a geographic and temporal patchwork4,5. Here we reveal the accelerated, albeit contrasting, patterns of glacier mass loss during the early twenty-first century. Using largely untapped satellite archives, we chart surface elevation changes at a high spatiotemporal resolution over all of Earth’s glaciers. We extensively validate our estimates against independent, high-precision measurements and present a globally complete and consistent estimate of glacier mass change. We show that during 2000–2019, glaciers lost a mass of 267 ± 16 gigatonnes per year, equivalent to 21 ± 3 per cent of the observed sea-level rise6. We identify a mass loss acceleration of 48 ± 16 gigatonnes per year per decade, explaining 6 to 19 per cent of the observed acceleration of sea-level rise. Particularly, thinning rates of glaciers outside ice sheet peripheries doubled over the past two decades. Glaciers currently lose more mass, and at similar or larger acceleration rates, than the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets taken separately7–9. By uncovering the patterns of mass change in many regions, we find contrasting glacier fluctuations that agree with the decadal variability in precipitation and temperature. These include a North Atlantic anomaly of decelerated mass loss, a strongly accelerated loss from northwestern American glaciers, and the apparent end of the Karakoram anomaly of mass gain10. We anticipate our highly resolved estimates to advance the understanding of drivers that govern the distribution of glacier change, and to extend our capabilities of predicting these changes at all scales. Predictions robustly benchmarked against observations are critically needed to design adaptive policies for the local- and regional-scale management of water resources and cryospheric risks, as well as for the global-scale mitigation of sea-level rise.},

	abstract = {The hydrological response to climate change in mountainous basins manifests itself at varying spatial and temporal scales, ranging from catchment to large river basin scale and from sub-daily to decade and century scale. To robustly assess the 21st century climate change impact for hydrology in entire High Mountain Asia ({HMA}) at a wide range of scales, we use a high resolution cryospherichydrological model covering 15 upstream {HMA} basins to quantify the compound effects of future changes in precipitation and temperature based on the range of climate change projections in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate model ensemble. Our analysis reveals contrasting responses for {HMA}'s rivers, dictated by their hydrological regimes. At the seasonal scale, the earlier onset of melting causes a shift in the magnitude and peak of water availability, to earlier in the year. At the decade to century scale, after an initial increase, the glacier melt declines by the mid or end of the century except for the Tarim river basin, where it continues to increase. Despite a large variability in hydrological regimes across {HMA}'s rivers, our results indicate relatively consistent climate change responses across {HMA} in terms of total water availability at decadal time scales. Although total water availability increases for the headwaters, changes in seasonality and magnitude may diverge widely between basins and need to be addressed while adapting to future changes in a region where food security, energy security as well as biodiversity, and the livelihoods of many depend on water from {HMA}.},

	abstract = {Siloed-approaches may fuel the misguided development of hydropower and subsequent target-setting under the sustainable development goals ({SDGs}). While hydropower development in the Indus basin is vital to ensure energy security ({SDG}7), it needs to be balanced with water use for fulfilling food ({SDG}2) and water ({SDG}6) security. Existing methods to estimate hydropower potential generally focus on: only one class of potential, a methodological advance for either of hydropower siting, sizing, or costing of one site, or the ranking of a portfolio of projects. A majority of them fall short in addressing sustainability. Hence, we develop a systematic framework for the basin-scale assessment of the sustainable hydropower potential by integrating considerations of the water-energy-food nexus, disaster risk, climate change, environmental protection, and socio-economic preferences. Considering the case of the upper Indus, the framework is developed by combining advances in literature, insights from local hydropower practitioners and over 30 datasets to represent real-life challenges to sustainable hydropower development, while distinguishing between small and large plants for two run-of-river plant configurations. The framework first addresses theoretical potential and successively constrains this further by stepwise inclusion of technical, economical, and sustainability criteria to obtain the sustainable exploitable hydropower potential. We conclude that sustainable hydropower potential in complex basins such as the Indus goes far beyond the hydrological boundary conditions. Our framework enables the careful inclusion of factors beyond the status-quo technological and economic criterions to guide policymakers in hydropower development decisions in the Indus and beyond. Future work will implement the framework to quantify the different hydropower potential classes and explore adaptation pathways to balance {SDG}7 with the other interlinked {SDGs} in the Indus.},

	abstract = {Across High Asia, the amount, timing, and spatial patterns of snow and ice melt play key roles in providing water for downstream irrigation, hydropower generation, and general consumption. The goal of this paper is to distinguish the specific contribution of seasonal snow versus glacier ice melt in the major basins of High Mountain Asia: Ganges, Brahmaputra, Indus, Amu Darya, and Syr Darya. Our methodology involves the application of MODIS-derived remote sensing products to separately calculate daily melt outputs from snow and glacier ice. Using an automated partitioning method, we generate daily maps of (1) snow over glacier ice, (2) exposed glacier ice, and (3) snow over land. These are inputs to a temperature index model that yields melt water volumes contributing to river flow. Results for the five major High Mountain Asia basins show that the western regions are heavily reliant on snow and ice melt sources for summer dry season flow when demand is at a peak, whereas monsoon rainfall dominates runoff during the summer period in the east. While uncertainty remains in the temperature index model applied here, our approach to partitioning melt from seasonal snow and glacier ice is both innovative and systematic and more constrained than previous efforts with similar goals.},
