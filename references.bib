	abstract = {{Sound water resources planning and management requires adequate data with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. This is especially true in the context of irrigated agriculture, which is one of the main consumptive users of the world's freshwater resources. Existing remote sensing methods for the management of irrigated agricultural systems are often based on empirical cropland data that are difficult to obtain, and that put into question the transferability of mapping algorithms in space and time. Here we implement an automatic irrigation mapping procedure in Google Earth Engine that uses surface reflectance satellite imagery from different sensors. The method is based on unsupervised training of a pixel-by-pixel classification algorithm within image regions identified through unsupervised object-based segmentation, followed by multi-temporal image analysis to distinguish productive irrigated fields from non-productive and non-irrigated areas. Ground-based data are not required. The final output of the mapping algorithm are monthly and annual irrigation maps (30 m resolution). The novel method is applied to the Central Asian Chu and Talas River Basins that are shared between upstream Kyrgyzstan and downstream Kazakhstan. We calculate the development of irrigated areas from 2000 to 2017 and assess the classification results in terms of robustness and accuracy. Based on seven available validation scenes (in total more than 2.5 million pixels) the classification accuracy is 77--96\%. We show that on the Kyrgyz side of the Talas basin, the identified increasing trends over the years are highly significant (23\% area increase between 2000 and 2017). In the Kazakh parts of the basins the irrigated acreages are relatively stable over time, but the average irrigation frequency within Soviet-era irrigation perimeters is very low, which points to a poor physical condition of the irrigation infrastructure and inadequate water supply.}},

@article{barbarossa_2018,
	abstract = {Streamflow data is highly relevant for a variety of socio-economic as well as ecological analyses or applications, but a high-resolution global streamflow dataset is yet lacking. We created FLO1K, a consistent streamflow dataset at a resolution of 30 arc seconds (\~{}1 km) and global coverage. FLO1K comprises mean, maximum and minimum annual flow for each year in the period 1960--2015, provided as spatially continuous gridded layers. We mapped streamflow by means of artificial neural networks (ANNs) regression. An ensemble of ANNs were fitted on monthly streamflow observations from 6600 monitoring stations worldwide, i.e., minimum and maximum annual flows represent the lowest and highest mean monthly flows for a given year. As covariates we used the upstream-catchment physiography (area, surface slope, elevation) and year-specific climatic variables (precipitation, temperature, potential evapotranspiration, aridity index and seasonality indices). Confronting the maps with independent data indicated good agreement (R2 values up to 91{\%}). FLO1K delivers essential data for freshwater ecology and water resources analyses at a global scale and yet high spatial resolution.},

Yet, owing to the scarcity of constrained mass loss observations, glacier evolution during the satellite era is known only partially, as a geographic and temporal patchwork4,5. Here we reveal the accelerated, albeit contrasting, patterns of glacier mass loss during the early twenty-first century. Using largely untapped satellite archives, we chart surface elevation changes at a high spatiotemporal resolution over all of Earth's glaciers. We extensively validate our estimates against independent, high-precision measurements and present a globally complete and consistent estimate of glacier mass change. We show that during 2000--2019, glaciers lost a mass of 267 $\pm$ 16 gigatonnes per year, equivalent to 21 $\pm$ 3 per cent of the observed sea-level rise6. We identify a mass loss acceleration of 48 $\pm$ 16 gigatonnes per year per decade, explaining 6 to 19 per cent of the observed acceleration of sea-level rise. Particularly, thinning rates of glaciers outside ice sheet peripheries doubled over the past two decades. Glaciers currently lose more mass, and at similar or larger acceleration rates, than the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets taken separately7--9. By uncovering the patterns of mass change in many regions, we find contrasting glacier fluctuations that agree with the decadal variability in precipitation and temperature. These include a North Atlantic anomaly of decelerated mass loss, a strongly accelerated loss from northwestern American glaciers, and the apparent end of the Karakoram anomaly of mass gain10. We anticipate our highly resolved estimates to advance the understanding of drivers that govern the distribution of glacier change, and to extend our capabilities of predicting these changes at all scales.

	abstract = {Seasonal snowpack is an essential component in the hydrological cycle and plays a significant role in supplying water resources to downstream users. Yet the snow water equivalent ({SWE}) in seasonal snowpacks, and its space-time variation, remains highly uncertain, especially over mountainous areas with complex terrain and sparse observations, such as 10 in High-Mountain Asia ({HMA}). In this work, we assessed the spatiotemporal distribution of seasonal {SWE}, obtained from a new 18-year {HMA} Snow Reanalysis ({HMASR}) dataset, as part of the recent {NASA} High-Mountain Asia Team ({HiMAT}) effort. A Bayesian snow reanalysis scheme previously developed to assimilate satellite derived fractional snow-covered area ({fSCA}) products from Landsat and {MODIS} platforms has been applied to develop the {HMASR} dataset (at a spatial resolution of 16 arc-second ({\textasciitilde}500 m) and daily temporal resolution) over the joint Landsat-{MODIS} period covering Water 15 Years ({WYs}) 2000-2017. Based on the results, the {HMA}-wide total {SWE} volume is found to be around 163 km3 on average and ranges from 114 km3 ({WY}2001) to 227 km3 ({WY}2005) when assessed over 18 {WYs}. The most abundant snowpacks are found in the northwestern basins (e.g. Indus, Syr Darya and Amu Darya) that are mainly affected by the westerlies, accounting for around 66\% of total seasonal {SWE} volume. When examining the elevational distribution over the {HMA} domain, seasonal {SWE} volume peaks at mid-elevations (around 3500 m), with over 50\% of the volume stored above 3500 20 m. This work brings new insight into understanding the climatology and variability of seasonal snowpack over {HMA}, with the regional snow reanalysis constrained by remote sensing data, providing a new reference dataset for future studies of seasonal snow and how it contributes to the water cycle and climate over the {HMA} region.},

High Mountain Asia for 2000–2016, derived by correcting observed glacier thinning patterns
for mass redistribution due to ice flow. We find that 41\% of glaciers accumulated mass over
less than 20\% of their area, and only 60\% ± 10\% of regional annual ablation was compensated by accumulation. Even without 21st century warming, 21\% ± 1\% of ice volume will
be lost by 2100 due to current climatic-geometric imbalance, representing a reduction in
glacier ablation into rivers of 28\% ± 1\%. The ablation of glaciers in the Himalayas and Tien
Shan was mostly unsustainable and ice volume in these regions will reduce by at least 30\%
by 2100. The most important and vulnerable glacier-fed river basins (Amu Darya, Indus, Syr

	abstract = {The hydrological response to climate change in mountainous basins manifests itself at varying spatial and temporal scales, ranging from catchment to large river basin scale and from sub-daily to decade and century scale. To robustly assess the 21st century climate change impact for hydrology in entire High Mountain Asia ({HMA}) at a wide range of scales, we use a high resolution cryospherichydrological model covering 15 upstream {HMA} basins to quantify the compound effects of future changes in precipitation and temperature based on the range of climate change projections in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate model ensemble. Our analysis reveals contrasting responses for {HMA}'s rivers, dictated by their hydrological regimes. At the seasonal scale, the earlier onset of melting causes a shift in the magnitude and peak of water availability, to earlier in the year. At the decade to century scale, after an initial increase, the glacier melt declines by the mid or end of the century except for the Tarim river basin, where it continues to increase. Despite a large variability in hydrological regimes across {HMA}'s rivers, our results indicate relatively consistent climate change responses across {HMA} in terms of total water availability at decadal time scales. Although total water availability increases for the headwaters, changes in seasonality and magnitude may diverge widely between basins and need to be addressed while adapting to future changes in a region where food security, energy security as well as biodiversity, and the livelihoods of many depend on water from {HMA}.},

	abstract = {Siloed-approaches may fuel the misguided development of hydropower and subsequent target-setting under the sustainable development goals ({SDGs}). While hydropower development in the Indus basin is vital to ensure energy security ({SDG}7), it needs to be balanced with water use for fulfilling food ({SDG}2) and water ({SDG}6) security. Existing methods to estimate hydropower potential generally focus on: only one class of potential, a methodological advance for either of hydropower siting, sizing, or costing of one site, or the ranking of a portfolio of projects. A majority of them fall short in addressing sustainability. Hence, we develop a systematic framework for the basin-scale assessment of the sustainable hydropower potential by integrating considerations of the water-energy-food nexus, disaster risk, climate change, environmental protection, and socio-economic preferences. Considering the case of the upper Indus, the framework is developed by combining advances in literature, insights from local hydropower practitioners and over 30 datasets to represent real-life challenges to sustainable hydropower development, while distinguishing between small and large plants for two run-of-river plant configurations. The framework first addresses theoretical potential and successively constrains this further by stepwise inclusion of technical, economical, and sustainability criteria to obtain the sustainable exploitable hydropower potential. We conclude that sustainable hydropower potential in complex basins such as the Indus goes far beyond the hydrological boundary conditions. Our framework enables the careful inclusion of factors beyond the status-quo technological and economic criterions to guide policymakers in hydropower development decisions in the Indus and beyond. Future work will implement the framework to quantify the different hydropower potential classes and explore adaptation pathways to balance {SDG}7 with the other interlinked {SDGs} in the Indus.},

	abstract = {Across High Asia, the amount, timing, and spatial patterns of snow and ice melt play key roles in providing water for downstream irrigation, hydropower generation, and general consumption. The goal of this paper is to distinguish the specific contribution of seasonal snow versus glacier ice melt in the major basins of High Mountain Asia: Ganges, Brahmaputra, Indus, Amu Darya, and Syr Darya. Our methodology involves the application of MODIS-derived remote sensing products to separately calculate daily melt outputs from snow and glacier ice. Using an automated partitioning method, we generate daily maps of (1) snow over glacier ice, (2) exposed glacier ice, and (3) snow over land. These are inputs to a temperature index model that yields melt water volumes contributing to river flow. Results for the five major High Mountain Asia basins show that the western regions are heavily reliant on snow and ice melt sources for summer dry season flow when demand is at a peak, whereas monsoon rainfall dominates runoff during the summer period in the east. While uncertainty remains in the temperature index model applied here, our approach to partitioning melt from seasonal snow and glacier ice is both innovative and systematic and more constrained than previous efforts with similar goals.},

We apply the method to the ERA5 precipitation archive and MODIS monthly cloud cover frequency to develop a daily gridded precipitation time series in 1 km resolution for the years 2003 onward. Comparison of the predictions with existing gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network indicates an improvement in the spatio-temporal performance of the downscaled data in predicting precipitation. Regional scrutiny of the cloud cover correction from the continental United States further indicates that CHELSA-EarthEnv performs well in comparison to other precipitation products. The CHELSA-EarthEnv daily precipitation product improves the temporal accuracy compared with a large improvement in the spatial accuracy especially in complex terrain.}},

	abstract = {Available energy (often expressed in terms of potential evaporation) and precipitation largely determine annual evapotranspiration and runoff rates in a region. The ratio of annual potential evaporation to precipitation, referred to as the aridity index by Budyko, has been shown to describe the evaporation ratio (the ratio of annual evapotranspiration to precipitation) of catchments from a range of climatic regimes in a number of studies. It has been shown that aridity index alone can be used to obtain an estimate of ratio of standard deviation of annual evapotranspiration estimates to that of precipitation (the evaporation deviation ratio). At present, there are at least five functional forms available, which describe evaporation ratio as a function of aridity index. This study assesses data from Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis' (CCCma) third-generation atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) against these five functional forms. Evaporation ratio and evaporation deviation ratios from an AGCM simulation are compared against these five functional forms and it is shown that the primary control of available energy and precipitation over annual partitioning of precipitation, and interannual variability of evapotranspiration, is preserved well in the AGCM. The aridity index is further used to obtain an analytic equation, which can be used to estimate change in runoff given annual changes in precipitation and available energy. This equation is validated using data from control and climate change simulations of the CCCma coupled GCM (CGCM1) and shown to perform fairly well. The correlation between CGCM1 simulated annual change in runoff and the values obtained using aridity index is consistently around 0.95, and the average bias varies between 40.5 and 50.3mm/year, for the five functional forms. The successful validation of this equation against data from a GCM climate change simulation illustrates the continued relevance of aridity index, and the primary control of precipitation and available energy in determining annual evapotranspiration and runoff rates.},

Accelerating anthropogenic land-use and climate change have sparked a renewed interest in predictive applications of the Budyko equation to analyze future scenarios important to water resource management. These applications, in turn, have inspired a number of attempts to derive mathematical models of the Budyko equation from a variety of specific assumptions about the original Budyko hypothesis. Here, we show that the Budyko equation and all extant models of it can be derived rigorously from a single mathematical assumption concerning the Budyko hypothesis. The implications of this fact for parametric models of the Budyko equation also are explored.}},

	abstract = {{A warmer climate may lead to less precipitation falling as snow in cold seasons. Such a switch in the state of precipitation not only alters temporal distribution of intra-annual runoff but also tends to yield less total annual runoff. Long-term water balance for 282 catchments across China is investigated, showing that a decreasing snow ratio reduces annual runoff for a given total precipitation. Within the Budyko framework, we develop an equation to quantify the relationship between snow ratio and annual runoff from a water--energy balance viewpoint. Based on the proposed equation, attribution of runoff change during the past several decades and possible runoff change induced by projected snow ratio change using climate experiment outputs archived in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are analyzed. Results indicate that annual runoff in northwestern mountainous and northern high-latitude areas are sensitive to snow ratio change. The proposed model is applicable to other catchments easily and quantitatively for analyzing the effects of possible change in snow ratio on available water resources and evaluating the vulnerability of catchments to climate change.}},

	abstract = {{Projections of future climate change play a fundamental role in improving understanding of the climate system as well as characterizing societal risks and response options. The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 ∘C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017--2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018--2020 period.}},

@article{rihai_2017,
	abstract = {{ This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400--1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2$\,^{\circ}$C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).}},

@article{kotlarski_2014,
	abstract = {{EURO-CORDEX is an international climate downscaling initiative that aims to provide high-resolution climate scenarios for Europe. Here an evaluation of the ERA-Interim-driven EURO-CORDEX regional climate model (RCM) ensemble is presented. The study documents the performance of the individual models in representing the basic spatiotemporal patterns of the European climate for the period 1989--2008. Model evaluation focuses on near-surface air temperature and precipitation, and uses the E-OBS data set as observational reference. The ensemble consists of 17 simulations carried out by seven different models at grid resolutions of 12 km (nine experiments) and 50 km (eight experiments). Several performance metrics computed from monthly and seasonal mean values are used to assess model performance over eight subdomains of the European continent. Results are compared to those for the ERA40-driven ENSEMBLES simulations.  The analysis confirms the ability of RCMs to capture the basic features of the European climate, including its variability in space and time. But it also identifies nonnegligible deficiencies of the simulations for selected metrics, regions and seasons. Seasonally and regionally averaged temperature biases are mostly smaller than 1.5 $\,^{\circ}$C, while precipitation biases are typically located in the $\pm$40\% range. Some bias characteristics, such as a predominant cold and wet bias in most seasons and over most parts of Europe and a warm and dry summer bias over southern and southeastern Europe reflect common model biases. For seasonal mean quantities averaged over large European subdomains, no clear benefit of an increased spatial resolution (12 vs. 50 km) can be identified. The bias ranges of the EURO-CORDEX ensemble mostly correspond to those of the ENSEMBLES simulations, but some improvements in model performance can be identified (e.g., a less pronounced southern European warm summer bias). The temperature bias spread across different configurations of one individual model can be of a similar magnitude as the spread across different models, demonstrating a strong influence of the specific choices in physical parameterizations and experimental setup on model performance. Based on a number of simply reproducible metrics, the present study quantifies the currently achievable accuracy of RCMs used for regional climate simulations over Europe and provides a quality standard for future model developments.}},

abstract = {{Temperature index or degree-day models rest upon a claimed relationship between snow or ice melt and air temperature usually expressed in the form of positive temperatures. Since air temperature generally is the most readily available data, such models have been the most widely used method of ice and snow melt computations for many purposes, such as hydrological modelling, ice dynamic modelling or climate sensitivity studies. Despite their simplicity, temperature-index models have proven to be powerful tools for melt modelling, often on a catchment scale outperforming energy balance models. However, two shortcomings are evident: (1) although working well over long time periods their accuracy decreases with increasing temporal resolution; (2) spatial variability cannot be modelled accurately as melt rates may vary substantially due to topographic effects such as shading, slope and aspect angles. These effects are particularly crucial in mountain areas. This paper provides an overview of temperature-index methods, including glacier environments, and discusses recent advances on distributed approaches attempting to account for topographic effects in complex terrain, while retaining scarcity of data input. In the light of an increasing demand for melt estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution, such approaches need further refinement and development.}},

The objectives were to improve its potential for making use of spatially distributed data, to make it more physically sound and to improve the model performance. The new version, HBV-96, uses subbasin division with a typical resolution of 40 km 2, although any resolution can be used. In addition, each subbasin is divided into elevation bands, vegetation and snow classes. Automatic weighting of precipitation and temperature stations was introduced and a new automatic calibration scheme was developed. The modifications led to significant improvements in model performance.

	abstract = {A framework is provided for scaling and scale issues in hydrology. The first section gives some basic definitions. This is important as researchers do not seem to have agreed on the meaning of concepts such as scale or upscaling. `Process scale', `observation scale' and `modelling (working) scale' require different definitions. The second section discusses heterogeneity and variability in catchments and touches on the implications of randomness and organization for scaling. The third section addresses the linkages across scales from a modelling point of view. It is argued that upscaling typically consists of two steps: distributing and aggregating. Conversely, downscaling involves disaggregation and singling out. Different approaches are discussed for linking state variables, parameters, inputs and conceptualizations across scales. This section also deals with distributed parameter models, which are one way of linking conceptualizations across scales. The fourth section addresses the linkages across scales from a more holistic perspective dealing with dimensional analysis and similarity concepts. The main difference to the modelling point of view is that dimensional analysis and similarity concepts deal with complex processes in a much simpler fashion. Examples of dimensional analysis, similarity analysis and functional normalization in catchment hydrology are given. This section also briefly discusses fractals, which are a popular tool for quantifying variability across scales. The fifth section focuses on one particular aspect of this holistic view, discussing stream network analysis. The paper concludes with identifying key issues and gives some directions for future research.},

@article{refsgaard_uncertainty_2007,
	abstract = {A terminology and typology of uncertainty is presented together with a framework for the modelling process, its interaction with the broader water management process and the role of uncertainty at different stages in the modelling processes. Brief reviews have been made of 14 different (partly complementary) methods commonly used in uncertainty assessment and characterisation: data uncertainty engine (DUE), error propagation equations, expert elicitation, extended peer review, inverse modelling (parameter estimation), inverse modelling (predictive uncertainty), Monte Carlo analysis, multiple model simulation, NUSAP, quality assurance, scenario analysis, sensitivity analysis, stakeholder involvement and uncertainty matrix. The applicability of these methods has been mapped according to purpose of application, stage of the modelling process and source and type of uncertainty addressed. It is concluded that uncertainty assessment is not just something to be added after the completion of the modelling work. Instead uncertainty should be seen as a red thread throughout the modelling study starting from the very beginning, where the identification and characterisation of all uncertainty sources should be performed jointly by the modeller, the water manager and the stakeholders. {\'O} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
