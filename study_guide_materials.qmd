# Study Guide and Materials {#sec-study-guide-materials .unnumbered}

This book was originally designed as part of a 2 week Master level course at the German Kazakh University in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The course was taught during the academic years 2021 and 2022. At least part of the material can be covered in 10 work days. Over the duration of two weeks, it is recommended to focus on only a subset of selected materials from the Handbook.

    -   Book Part I for regional and basin-scale hydrological and climatological characterization
    -   Selected Chapters of Part II
    -   Part III, Chapter 15 on hydraulic-hydrological modeling
    -   Part III, Chapter 17 on real-world examples
-   **SCIENCE Learning Track: Applied Hydrological Modeling using long-term water balance modeling**
    -   Book Part I for regional and basin-scale hydrological and climatological characterization
    -   Selected Chapters of Part II
    -   Part III, Chapter 14 on long-term water balance modeling

All learning tracks presented here require significant investments by the students. It is clear that the students cannot learning everything though in a short time and achieve proficiency in GIS geospatial data analysis, computer programming and modeling. Hence, it pays to focus. We presented here a study guide for the Applied Modeling track.

## Study Guide {#sec-study-guide .unnumbered}

Over the duration of the course and as part of the Applied Modeling track, students are guided through implementing their own conceptual hydrological rainfall-runoff model of one of the Central Asian sample catchments that they can choose from the [Case Studies Pack](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tucg4eno67ndpp0/AADpkSbovUpBx5vhzUJuDquwa?dl=0).

Students are required to work through the Chapters, including the occasional tasks that serve to deepen reflection on the course material and to do their daily homework assignments. As the final exam, the homework results are presented in a final student conference for which the students have to submit a conference abstract. This Chapter explains how to use this course book.

Different callout blocks appear throughout the text. These include *Exercise*, *Tasks* and *Take Home Messages*. *Caution* and *Warning* callouts highlight possibly problematic issues.

## EXERCISE

Exercise boxes are highlighted in blue color. With the description of the exercise, hints and a link to the solution are provided. Wherever they appear in the text, exercises should be completed before starting the next course chapter.

### Day 1: Introduction & Installation of Software {#sec-materials-day1 .unnumbered}

Read [Chapter 1: A short history of Water in Central Asia](#sec-short-history) and [Chapter 2: Hydrological Systems in Semi-Arid Central Asia](#sec-hydrology-of-central-asia) in the course book. Then make sure the required software for this course is installed on your computer. Section [Open-source resources of the Appendix](#sec-appendix_a_free_software) includes installation instructions and the on-line learning material that can get you started with the software. Below is a quick summary:

-   [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/)\
-   [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
-   [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)\
-   [RS Minerve](https://www.crealp.ch/fr/accueil/outils-services/logiciels/rs-minerve/telechargement-rsm.html)

If you have not used the software above before we recommend the following resources to get your started (remember, more detailed instructions are available in the [Appendix](#section-appendix-open-source-resources)):

-   [QGIS training manual](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/training_manual/index.html)\
-   [Modern Dive for getting started with R and RStudio](https://moderndive.com/index.html)\
-   [RS Minerve User Manual](https://www.crealp.ch/fr/accueil/outils-services/logiciels/rs-minerve/telechargement-rsm.html)

Inevitably, you will also perform a lot of geocomputations with R in the future. After all, a GIS system like QGIS is nothing more than a nicely packed bunch of geocomputation algorithms and a window for visualizing geospatial assets. Well, rest assured, all of this can be done inside R. It is recommended therefore that you also consult the following excellent online resource [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/index.html).

### Day 2: Catchment Characterization {#studyGuide-day2 .unnumbered}

Read the [Case Studies in Chapter 3](#CaseStudies) and [Station Data in Chapter 5](#Data::StationData) and do the exercise on catchment characterization, i.e. do a catchment characterization of your sample catchment.
